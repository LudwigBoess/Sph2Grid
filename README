-- sph2grid --

bin SPH particles to a grid.

Requirements: 
    - GSL
    - HDF5 
    - [FFTW >3.3] for P(k)
    - [SILO] for visit output

Todo: 

    - P(k)
        * calc P(k) in parallel
        * P(k) output in HDF5
        * adapt readgrid.pro IDL routine
    
    - fix / remove wsinc and tsinc distribution schemes
    
    - add Cui et al 2008 D12 distribution as the optimal
      wavelet way to bin sph to a grid. But where to get D12 from?

    - establish testing regression tests in a subdir
